Plugin/Widget for create horizontal menus, banners or galleries with a JQuery effect

== Description ==

<a href="http://www.pluginswp.com/jquery-horizontal-scroller/">Demo and plugin page</a>

Very easy to use. Load pictures directly from the library of images from your wordpress. Manage your images directly from the widget or plugin with a simple but powerful administration. The images has links options for customizing and seo labels for better search engine positioning.


== Installation ==


This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Install the plugin via the plugins menu in your administrator.
2. Activate it and you'll see a new menu option in the "JQUERY SCROLLER". We also see a new widget ready for use.
3. You can display the slider as a plugin, widget, or html code:

- Widget: Go to the widgets section of your administrator. You will see a new widget: JQUERY SCROLLER. Drag the widget to the sidebar you want. You can use as many as you like but only one at a time. Within the widget can manage and configure images that show the measurements.

- Plugin. In the menu of your wordpress administration will see a new button: "JQUERY SCROLLER". Once inside you can create the scroller you want. Click the "edit" to edit the scroller and images to show. The options are the same as the widget: measures and more. To display the scroller in your posts or pages you have to insert the code that appears next to each slider. The following code: [scroller 1 /] load the scroller 1. You can use scrollers as many as you like but only load one at a time.

- Html. You can use the plugin as HTML code and insert it directly where you want. The way to do this is by first using the plugin as a widget or plugin and edit the source code. Select the code between the tags:
<! - Jquery horizontal scroller-> and <! - End Jquery horizontal scroller->. Copy this html code where you want and the slider worked perfectly whenever a wordpress with plugin installed and active.
